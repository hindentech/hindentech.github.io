# Personal Blog Project

For my first project, I developed a website using **Jekyll, Ruby, Git Bash, GitHub, and GitHub Pages** to host a technical blog and a portfolio of my personal development projects. 

I have been building sites with WordPress for many years, but this was my first introduction to Jekyll. I found that I appreciate the responsiveness of interacting with a static website compared to utilizing a large content management system, like WordPress. To address the aesthetics of the website, I took advantage of one of the many polished Jekyll Themes and modified it to my liking. 

Learning how to use Git Bash, GitHub, and GitHub Pages together was completely foreign at first, but after reading a bit of documentation I was off to the races. GitHub Pages is a great platform for hosting a free personal website. I found this project to be a nice introduction to using GitHub as a code repository, since it will become a critical tool when pivoting away from using the Azure Portal to IaC/DevOps deployments. 

All things said, this was an enjoyable and rewarding way to spend an afternoon!

**Lesson of the Day:**
I purchased the domain for this project from Cloudflare. While I appreciate the "at cost" nature of Cloudflare's domain registration and the security options that are included, I learned that the basic registration tier does not allow for custom nameservers. Unfortunately, this prevented me from moving the domain into Azure DNS. Luckily, I have another active domain being managed by Azure DNS for development, but it may push me to transfer the domain to another registrar down the road.
