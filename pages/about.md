# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm an experienced IT Professional with a diverse skill set encompassing Windows Administration, Azure Architecture, Project Management, and Business Operations. My educational background consists of a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology and a Master's Degree in Business Administration, which together combined to fuel a passion for developing business solutions with the Azure Cloud. This website will host my technical blog and a portfolio of my development projects. I'm looking forward to learning new programming languages and strengthening my coding skills one project at a time!
